## R Markdown

**Testing merging abrev and credit hours
```{r}
test_credit = as.character(testing_credits)
test_abrev = as.character(Psych_course_abbreviations)
psyc_final = data.frame(as.vector(test_abrev), as.vector(test_credit))

```



Now creating a generalized program that will extract the course names and their corresponding credit hours from the list of all college department URLs.

Showing first few urls to be put into function.
```{r}
head(final_course_urls)

```

Small subset of URLS for testing as I create function:
```{r}
Some_Course_URLs=head(final_course_urls)

```


```{r}
AbrevAndCredit_Extractor= function(x){
  read_html(x) %>%
  html_nodes(".courseblocktitle") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  str_extract_all(pattern= "[:blank:][:digit:]{3}") %>%
  str_replace_all(pattern = "[:blank:]", replacement = "")
}

AbrevAndCredit_Extractor(Some_Course_URLs)


```
